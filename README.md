This is a work day scheduler application that runs in the browser and allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day (from 9 AM through 5 PM).  

At the start of the application, the user is presented with the current date and time displayed in the jumbotron at the top of the page. The date and time displayed will stay up to date on the page.  The page will also display rows of timeblocks corresponding to each hour of the work day.  The user is able to click into the text area of each timeblock and type in an event for that hour.  By clicking the save button next to the text area, the user can then save the text in that timeblock in local storage.  Events that are saved by the user will persist even after refreshing the page.

This application was created using many tools such as:
* html 
* css
* javascript
* jquery
* google fonts
* moment.js
* font awesome
* bootstrap  

Some of the methods used in creating this application were found from resources such as other classmates, W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and Stack Overflow.
